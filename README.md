## Introduction

I completed my certification last May 2022 and still have a lot to learn. So, decided to create this site as a way to put together what I learn and share it to everyone at the same time. If anyone would like to contribute or ask something related to this site, you may use the links social media account link I have provided above.

## Tools  

Most of the tools for data analyst are quite new to me, except for SQL and Python. Right now, what I am trying to achieve is to learn how to each program works for data analysis. By experience,I learned the best way to learn a (computer) language is to put it in action. What I'am currently going for is to familiarize myself on how each program works and how they are used for data analysis.

In addition, here are some things to take note of when learning a language:
- code readability and reuse
- robust
- can it be extended
