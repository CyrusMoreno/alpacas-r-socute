## Data Science And Beyond

First of all, thank you for taking time to read my page.

Let me start off by saying, I love Data Science. 

Before I started this [Course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), understanding the importance of data in business like digital marketing is something though to grasp for me. 

I am curious on how someone can make money out data of me liking meme pictures on the internet, and searching for pc gaming related topics. Now, it all make sense.

As you may know, adult life are made of big decisions, most are yours to decide on while some decisions may have to be made by others for you.

This doesn’t mean that Data Science is used to steal information, that depends on how you decide to use it. The knowledge in Data Science is more of being granted a the power to spread good in a somewhat chaotic world. 

To appreciate the role of Data Science in our daily lives, one must understand the importance of finding the best insight available based on your decision. 

And, that is the job for a data analyst.

To showcase what I have learned, below are some case studies I have completed in this [Course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) to showcase what I have learn:
