#### Welcome to my portfolio! I specialize in data analysis and visualization, with a focus on making complex data into understandable and actionable results.

## About Me

I’m a data enthusiast skilled in Python, R, Tableau, SQL, Excel, and Google Sheets, with a knack for turning raw data into actionable insights. My journey began with the [Google Data Analyst Course](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/ZVCWVNBZ35LT) in 2022, where I first analyzed Bike Share data.

Though my initial visualization was static and limited to a month’s data, I’ve since revisited the project. Now, I’ve created an interactive visualization that spans a full year’s data, demonstrating my growth and adaptability in data analysis.

## Case Study: Cyclistic Bike Share
#### How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

Here is the scenario, I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must apporove our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

In this project, I analyzed bike share data to uncover key usage patterns. I used data cleaning techniques to ensure the quality and accuracy of the data, followed by exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns.

#### Objectives:
-	Find out how annual members and casual riders use Cyclist bikes differently
-	Find out why would a casual riders converts to a annual memberships
-	Determine how digital media could influence causal riders to become a Cyclistic members.

> Casual riders are customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes

> Cyclistic members are customers who purchase annual memberships

#### Our Approach
1. Cleaning and Transforming the Data: I started with cleaning the data, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies. Given the large dataset, I utilized R and SQL for efficient processing and summarized the data for effective analysis in Excel, a tool widely used by employers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: I then performed an exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables.
3. Data Visualization: I used various visualization techniques to present my findings in an understandable and visually appealing way.

#### Interactive Dashboard
Here is a screenshot of the interactive dashboard I created using Excel. This dashboard allows users to explore the data in a user-friendly and intuitive manner.

#### Key Findings
- **Cyclistic members vs Casual:** There are significantly more annual membership users each month compared to casual users.
- **Travel Time:** On average, casual users spend more time on their travels compared to annual membership users.
- **Weekend Usage:** During weekends, the number of casual and membership users is more or less the same. However, casual users still spend more time traveling.

While the dataset didn’t provide specific user data, it did include the locations of bike stations. I transformed this data to identify the top 20 routes for both membership and casual users.

The exact reasons for these route preferences, whether for commuting to work, weekly fitness routines, or grocery shopping, remain unknown. However, this information can be leveraged for marketing strategies.

I recommend investigating the establishments near these popular stations, such as grocery stores, parks, malls, etc. This could provide casual users with alternative, shorter duration trips.

Additionally, if casual users are using the service for commuting, suggesting stations near apartment buildings could offer them a shorter commute if they choose to relocate.

These efforts could potentially convert casual users into annual members, thereby increasing the user base and overall profitability. Lastly, here is the link to this [project’s dashboard](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AlqOSNWLwB1YiUAwyE4vUIPC8NrR?e=joqo7M).
