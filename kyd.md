### Data analysts typically work with six problem types [^3]

#### Making predictions
 Example of industry problems that use predictive analysis [^1]
 - Automotive new technology emerging
 - Aerospace a real-time analytics application to predict subsystem performance
 - Energy Production predicting electricity price and demand
 - Financial Services to predict credit risk.
 - Industrial Automation and Machinery predicting machine failures
 - Medical Devices using pattern-detection algorithms to spot asthma and COPD

#### Categorizing things

Categorize things correlate certain actions taken with attaining goal.

#### Spotting something unusual

Looking at normal trend.

#### Identifying themes

Similar to Categorizing things but you have to group into themes that data analysts want to explore or looking for. See [^2]

#### Discovering connections

Like connecting the dots. Looking for Cause - Effect relationship in the data.

Looking for trends to answer a business problem
